        known as Hind''s Crimson Star, R Leporis is a rare star in planet Earth''s
        night sky. It''s also a shocking shade of red. The star''s discoverer, 19th
        century English astronomer John Russell Hind, reported that it appeared in
        a telescope \"... like a drop of blood on a black field.\" Located 1,360 light-years
        away in the constellation Lepus the star is a Mira-type variable, changing
        its brightness over a period of about 14 months. R Leporis is now recognized
        as a carbon star, a very cool and highly evolved red giant with an extreme
        abundance of carbon. Extra carbon in carbon stars is created by helium fusion
        near the dying stellar core and dredged up into the stars'' outer layers.
        The dredge-up results in an overabundance of simple carbon molecules, like
        CO, CH, CN, and C2. While it''s true that cool stars radiate most of their
        energy in red and infrared light, the carbon molecules strongly absorb what
        little blue light is left and give carbon stars an exceptionally deep red
        color.  R Leporis is losing its carbon-rich atmosphere into the surrounding
        interstellar material through a strong stellar wind though, and could be near
        the transition to a planetary nebula. Oh, and Happy Halloween from the folks
        at APOD.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1811/RLeporisMP.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"R
